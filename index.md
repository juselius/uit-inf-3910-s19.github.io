The GitHub organization for this course is [uit-inf-3910-s19](https://github.com/uit-inf-3910-s19)

We have a [Slack team](https://uit-inf-3910-s19.slack.com/). Join us and chat about the course and the assignments.

Please ruminate on [this page about citation, plagiarism, &c. from the university](https://uit.no/om/enhet/artikkel?p_document_id=473719). Norwegian only.

### We have the following rooms and hours:

* Monday 10:15-12:00 Teknobygget 2.019AUD
* Wednesday 11:15-12:00 REALF B203 (Lille Aud)
* Thursday 8:15-10:00 REALF A051

The Monday's lectures will be devoted to more theoretical aspects of functional
programming. The lectures on Wednesday and Thursday will be of a more practical
nature, focusing on application in F#.

Refer to the lecture plan, and information in Slack for which room is used when.
